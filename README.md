11ThPlayTime Plugin Introduction
The 11ThPlayTime plugin is designed to track and manage players' playtime effectively, offering features tailored for reward systems, session tracking, and AFK management.

Key Features:
Session Time Tracking: Each session's playtime is reset upon rejoining, allowing players to track their current session duration.
Weekly Playtime Reset: Playtime is recalculated every week, making it ideal for weekly reward systems.
Total Playtime Calculation: Tracks the overall playtime of each player.
GUI Leaderboard: View the top 5 players for weekly playtime and check your own ranking.
AFK System: Players go AFK after a certain period of inactivity.
AFK Protection: AFK players cannot be attacked, hit, or messaged.
AFK Animation: A bubble chat animation (zZz...) appears above AFK playersâ€™ heads.
Fair Playtime Tracking: AFK time is counted for session and total playtime but not included in weekly playtime, ensuring fairness in reward systems.
Exit AFK Mode by Moving: Simply move to return to active play mode.
With 11ThPlayTime, server owners can easily track player activity, maintain a fair reward system, and enhance the overall gameplay experience. ðŸš€
